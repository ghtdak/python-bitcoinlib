- Script engine exists, but is not yet integrated with node.py

- Appears to have difficulty talking to nodes with protocol versions
  between 40000 and 50001, inclusive.

- Truncated or corrupted serialization may crash the program...
  must test and see which exceptions are thrown.

- GDBM is not exactly a fully transactional database, and using
  multiple GDBM tables means data may get out of sync even if
  GDBM file integrity is retained during a crash.
