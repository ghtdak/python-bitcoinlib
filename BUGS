- Script engine exists, but is not yet integrated with node.py

- Does not support chain reorg, and will get stuck on an orphan
  chain, if one occurs.  Workaround:  Restore from backup, or
  delete *.dat and download the block chain again.

- Appears to have difficulty talking to nodes with protocol versions
  between 40000 and 50001, inclusive.

- Truncated or corrupted serialization may crash the program...
  must test and see which exceptions are thrown.
