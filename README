This python script (node.py) is a client node for the bitcoin network.
It is based on ArtForz' half-a-node at http://pastebin.com/ZSM7iHZw

In its current form, node.py does nothing more than listen for new
transactions and blocks, perform some simple verification checks on
the data, and store them in a database.  It does not handle script
verification or chain reorg, and is therefore not safe for general use.
See BUGS and TODO files.

It might be useful as the base for a P2P monitoring node, or similar
tasks.

Command line usage:

	./node.py my-config-file

The configuration file is a key=value text file, with the following settings:

	# hostname or IP address of network node to connect to
	host=127.0.0.1

	# port of network node to connect to (default: 8333)
	port=8333

	# database directory
	db=/tmp/chaindb

	# log filename, or '-' or no-value for standard output
	log=/tmp/chaindb/node.log

	# if present, import these blocks into the block database
	loadblock=/tmp/blk0001.dat

node.py connects to a single remote node, and does not accept incoming
P2P connections.  If the connection is lost, node.py exits.
